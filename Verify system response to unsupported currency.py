  "text": "Here is a sample Selenium Python test script for the given test case:

```python
import pytest
import allure
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Set up logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Set up Allure
from allure_commons.types import AttachmentType

@pytest.fixture
def driver():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    yield driver
    driver.quit()

@pytest.mark.parametrize("currency", ["ZAR", "JPY", "ZZZ"])
def test_unsupported_currency(driver, currency):
    with allure.step("Open the webpage"):
        driver.get("https://example.com")

    with allure.step("Enter valid inputs and select unsupported currency"):
        input_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "currencyInput")
        input_field.send_keys(currency)

    with allure.step("Submit the form"):
        submit_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "submitButton")
        submit_button.click()

    with allure.step("Verify system response"):
        alert_message = driver.find_element(By.ID, "alertMessage").text
        assert "selected currency is not supported" in alert_message

        allure.attach(driver.get_screenshot_as_png(), name="Screenshot", attachment_type=AttachmentType.PNG)

```

This script sets up a Chrome WebDriver, opens a webpage, enters an unsupported currency code in the input field, submits the form, verifies the system response, captures a screenshot on test failure, and integrates with Allure for reporting.

To run this script in IntelliJ, you need to have Python and the necessary Selenium and Allure libraries installed. You can also customize the script further based on your specific requirements and application."
